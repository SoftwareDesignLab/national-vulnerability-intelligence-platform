  Unauthenticated Arbitrary User Creation Leads to Complete
  System Compromise
  (CVE-2023-25589)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of
    ClearPass Policy Manager could allow an unauthenticated
    remote attacker to create arbitrary users on the platform.
    A successful exploit allows an attacker to achieve total
    cluster compromise.

    Internal references: ATLCP-229
    Severity: Critical
    CVSSv3 Overall Score: 9.8
    CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

    Discovery: This vulnerability was discovered and reported by
    Daniel Jensen (@dozernz) via Aruba's Bug Bounty Program.


  Local Privilege Escalation in ClearPass OnGuard Linux Agent
  (CVE-2023-25590)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    A vulnerability in the ClearPass OnGuard Linux agent could
    allow malicious users on a Linux instance to elevate their
    user privileges to those of a higher role. A successful
    exploit allows malicious users to execute arbitrary code
    with root level privileges on the Linux instance.

    Internal references: ATLCP-235
    Severity: High
    CVSSv3 Overall Score: 7.8
    CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

    Discovery: This vulnerability was discovered and reported
    by Luke Young (bugcrowd.com/bored_engineer) via Aruba's Bug
    Bounty Program.


  Authenticated Information Disclosure in ClearPass Policy
  Manager Web-Based Management Interface
  (CVE-2023-25591)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of
    ClearPass Policy Manager could allow a remote attacker
    authenticated with low privileges to access sensitive
    information. A successful exploit allows an attacker to
    retrieve information which could be used to potentially gain
    further privileges on the ClearPass instance.

    Internal Reference: ATLCP-224
    Severity: High
    CVSSv3.x Overall Score: 7.6
    CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L

    Discovery: This vulnerability was discovered and reported
    by Luke Young (bugcrowd.com/bored_engineer) via Aruba's Bug
    Bounty program.


  Reflected Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities (XSS) in
  ClearPass Policy Manager Web-Based Management Interface
  (CVE-2023-25592, CVE-2023-25593)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Vulnerabilities within the web-based management interface
    of ClearPass Policy Manager could allow a remote attacker
    to conduct a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
    against a user of the interface. A successful exploit allows
    an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in a victim's
    browser in the context of the affected interface.

    Internal Reference: ATLCP-170, ATLCP-228
    Severity: High
    CVSSv3.x Overall Score: 7.1
    CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L

    Discovery: These vulnerabilities were discovered and
    reported by the AT&amp;T Security Team and Sicarius(@EIS1carius)
    of CBP.


  Authorization Bypass Leading to Privilege Escalation in
  ClearPass Policy Manager Web-Based Management Interface
  (CVE-2023-25594)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of
    ClearPass Policy Manager allows an attacker with read-only
    privileges to perform actions that change the state of the
    ClearPass Policy Manager instance. Successful exploitation
    of this vulnerability allows an attacker to complete
    state-changing actions in the web-based management interface
    that should not be allowed by their current level of
    authorization on the platform.

    Internal References: ATLCP-237
    Severity: Medium
    CVSSv3.x Overall Score: 6.3
    CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

    Discovery: This vulnerability was discovered and reported by
    the Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager engineering team.

    that allows for an attacker with local Ubuntu instance
    access to potentially obtain sensitive information.
    Successful Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an
    attacker to retrieve information that is of a sensitive
    nature to the ClearPass/OnGuard environment.

    Internal Reference: ATLCP-231
    Severity: Medium
    CVSSv3.x Overall Score: 5.5
