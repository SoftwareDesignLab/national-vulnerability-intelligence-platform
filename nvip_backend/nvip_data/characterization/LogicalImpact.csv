An issue was discovered in Cypress (formerly Broadcom) WICED Studio 6.2 CYW20735B1 and CYW20819A1. As a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) packet is received it is copied into a Heap (ThreadX Block) buffer. The buffer allocated in dhmulp_getRxBuffer is four bytes too small to hold the maximum of 255 bytes plus headers. It is possible to corrupt a pointer in the linked list holding the free buffers of the g_mm_BLEDeviceToHostPool Block pool. This pointer can be fully controlled by overflowing with 3 bytes of packet data and the first byte of the packet CRC checksum. The checksum can be freely chosen by adapting the packet data accordingly. An attacker might be able to allocate the overwritten address as a receive buffer resulting in a write-what-where condition. This is fixed in BT SDK2.4 and BT SDK2.45.,Read

Apport reads and writes information on a crashed process to /proc/pid with elevated privileges. Apport then determines which user the crashed process belongs to by reading /proc/pid through get_pid_info() in data/apport. An unprivileged user could exploit this to read information about a privileged running process by exploiting PID recycling. This information could then be used to obtain ASLR offsets for a process with an existing memory corruption vulnerability. The initial fix introduced regressions in the Python Apport library due to a missing argument in Report.add_proc_environ in apport/report.py. It also caused an autopkgtest failure when reading /proc/pid and with Python 2 compatibility by reading /proc maps. The initial and subsequent regression fixes are in 2.20.11-0ubuntu16 2.20.11-0ubuntu8.6 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.12 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.22 and 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.29+esm3.,Read

An exploitable information leak vulnerability exists in the ustream-ssl library of OpenWrt versions 18.06.4 and 15.05.1. When connecting to a remote server the servers SSL certificate is checked but no action is taken when the certificate is invalid. An attacker could exploit this behavior by performing a man-in-the-middle attack providing any certificate leading to the theft of all the data sent by the client during the first request. After an SSL connection is initialized via _ustream_ssl_init and after any data (e.g. the clients HTTP request) is written to the stream using ustream_printf the code eventually enters the function __ustream_ssl_poll which is used to dispatch the read/write events,Read

In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0 a recently identified critical vulnerability resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port. This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database including escalating the attackers privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term isolated refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).,Read

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x allowing x86 Intel HVM guest OS users to cause a host OS denial of service or possibly gain privileges because of insufficient cache write-back under VT-d. When page tables are shared between IOMMU and CPU changes to them require flushing of both TLBs. Furthermore IOMMUs may be non-coherent and hence prior to flushing IOMMU TLBs a CPU cache also needs writing back to memory after changes were made. Such writing back of cached data was missing in particular when splitting large page mappings into smaller granularity ones. A malicious guest may be able to retain read/write DMA access to frames returned to Xens free pool and later reused for another purpose. Host crashes (leading to a Denial of Service) and privilege escalation cannot be ruled out. Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are affected. Only x86 Intel systems are affected. x86 AMD as well as Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 HVM guests using hardware assisted paging (HAP) having a passed through PCI device assigned and having page table sharing enabled can leverage the vulnerability. Note that page table sharing will be enabled (by default) only if Xen considers IOMMU and CPU large page size support compatible.,Read

PEAR Archive_Tar version 1.4.3 and earlier contains a CWE-502 CWE-915 vulnerability in the Archive_Tar class. There are several file operations with $v_header[filename] as parameter (such as file_exists is_file is_dir etc). When extract is called without a specific prefix path we can trigger unserialization by crafting a tar file with phar://[path_to_malicious_phar_file] as path. Object injection can be used to trigger destruct in the loaded PHP classes e.g. the Archive_Tar class itself. With Archive_Tar object injection arbitrary file deletion can occur because @unlink($this->_temp_tarname) is called. If another class with useful gadget is loaded it may possible to cause remote code execution that can result in files being deleted or possibly modified. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 1.4.4.,Resource Removal

Receipt of specially crafted UDP/IP packets over MPLS may be able to bypass a stateless firewall filter. The crafted UDP packets must be encapsulated and meet a very specific packet format to be classified in a way that bypasses IP firewall filter rules. The packets themselves do not cause a service interruption (e.g. RPD crash) but receipt of a high rate of UDP packets may be able to contribute to a denial of service attack. This issue only affects processing of transit UDP/IP packets over MPLS received on an interface with MPLS enabled.

An issue was discovered in the Bluetooth component of the Cypress (formerly owned by Broadcom) Wireless IoT codebase. Extended Inquiry Responses (EIRs) are improperly handled which causes a heap-based buffer overflow during device inquiry. This overflow can be used to overwrite existing functions with arbitrary code. The Reserved for Future Use (RFU) bits are not discarded by eir_handleRx() and are included in an EIRs length. Therefore one can exceed the expected 240 bytes which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow in eir_getReceivedEIR() called by bthci_event_SendInquiryResultEvent(). In order to exploit this bug an attacker must repeatedly connect to the victims device in a short amount of time from different source addresses. This will cause the victims Bluetooth stack to resolve the device names and therefore allocate buffers with attacker-controlled data. Due to the heap corruption the name will be eventually written to an attacker-controlled location leading to a write-what-where condition.,Write
