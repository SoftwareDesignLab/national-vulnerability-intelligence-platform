The last vulnerability allows for unrestricted access to the Backup Server component of a Sybase ASE installation Sybase ASE architecture includes Database Server Backup Server and XP Server components which communicate with each other When a database administrator runs the DUMP DATABASE command to backup a database the Database Server in turn makes a connection to the Backup Server Via a set of RPC calls it then instructs the Backup Server to perform a dump The problem is that the Backup Server (installed on the same box as the database server) does not validate credentials passed to it This makes it possible to connect and dump any database from remote servers The only requirement for such an attack is an open TCP port on the Backup server SAP released a fix for this vulnerability that prevents the Backup server from accepting connections originating from remote hosts by default (this can be changed by adding a trusted host to a configuration file),MultiFactor Authentication

Buffer over-reads were discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5153 The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse() parses CoAP input linearly using a while loop Once an option is parsed in a loop the current point (*packet_data_pptr) is increased correspondingly The pointer is restricted by the size of the received buffer as well as by the option delta and option length bytes The actual input packet length is not verified against the number of bytes read when processing the option extended delta and the option extended length Moreover the calculation of the message_left variable in the case of non-extended option deltas is incorrect and indicates more data left for processing than provided in the function input All of these lead to heap-based or stack-based memory location read access that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer Depending on the platform-specific memory management mechanisms it can lead to processing of unintended inputs or system memory access violation errors,ASLR

Huawei P20 smartphones with versions earlier than 1000156(C00E156R1P4) have an improper authentication vulnerability The vulnerability is due to that when an user wants to do certain operation the software insufficiently validate the users identity Attackers need to physically access the smartphone to exploit this vulnerability Successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the limit of student mode function,Physical Security
Certain Xerox WorkCentre printers before 073xxx00002300 do not require the user to reenter or validate LDAP bind credentials when changing the LDAP connector IP address A malicious actor who gains access to affected devices (eg by using default credentials) can change the LDAP connection IP address to a system owned by the actor without knowledge of the LDAP bind credentials After changing the LDAP connection IP address subsequent authentication attempts will result in the printer sending plaintext LDAP (Active Directory) credentials to the actor Although the credentials may belong to a non-privileged user organizations frequently use privileged service accounts to bind to Active Directory The attacker gains a foothold on the Active Directory domain at a minimum and may use the credentials to take over control of the Active Directory domain This affects 3655* 3655i* 58XX* 58XXi* 59XX* 59XXi* 6655** 6655i** 72XX* 72XXi* 78XX** 78XXi** 7970** 7970i** EC7836** and EC7856** devices,MultiFactor Authentication
