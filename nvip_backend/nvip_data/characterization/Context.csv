An issue was discovered on OnePlus 7 Pro devices before 10.0.3.GM21BA. The firmware was found to contain functionality that allows a privileged user (root) in the Rich Execution Environment (REE) to obtain bitmap images from the fingerprint sensor because of Leftover Debug Code. The issue is that the Trusted Application (TA) supports an extended number of commands beyond what is needed to implement a fingerprint authentication system compatible with Android. An attacker who is in the position to send commands to the TA (for example  the root user) is able to send a sequence of these commands that will result in the TA sending a raw fingerprint image to the REE. This means that the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) no longer protects identifiable fingerprint data from the REE.,Firmware

An issue was discovered in OpenVPN 2.4.x before 2.4.9. An attacker can inject a data channel v2 (P_DATA_V2) packet using a victim s peer-id. Normally such packets are dropped  but if this packet arrives before the data channel crypto parameters have been initialized  the victim s connection will be dropped. This requires careful timing due to the small time window (usually within a few seconds) between the victim client connection starting and the server PUSH_REPLY response back to the client. This attack will only work if Negotiable Cipher Parameters (NCP) is in use.,Channel

An issue was discovered in Arm Mbed TLS before 2.16.6 and 2.7.x before 2.7.15. An attacker that can get precise enough side-channel measurements can recover the long-term ECDSA private key by (1) reconstructing the projective coordinate of the result of scalar multiplication by exploiting side channels in the conversion to affine coordinates; (2) using an attack described by Naccache  Smart  and Stern in 2003 to recover a few bits of the ephemeral scalar from those projective coordinates via several measurements; and (3) using a lattice attack to get from there to the long-term ECDSA private key used for the signatures. Typically an attacker would have sufficient access when attacking an SGX enclave and controlling the untrusted OS.,Channel

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users to cause a denial of service via degenerate chains of linear pagetables  because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2017-15595.  Linear pagetables  is a technique which involves either pointing a pagetable at itself  or to another pagetable of the same or higher level. Xen has limited support for linear pagetables: A page may either point to itself  or point to another pagetable of the same level (i.e.  L2 to L2  L3 to L3  and so on). XSA-240 introduced an additional restriction that limited the  depth  of such chains by allowing pages to either *point to* other pages of the same level  or *be pointed to* by other pages of the same level  but not both. To implement this  we keep track of the number of outstanding times a page points to or is pointed to another page table  to prevent both from happening at the same time. Unfortunately  the original commit introducing this reset this count when resuming validation of a partially-validated pagetable  incorrectly dropping some  linear_pt_entry  counts. If an attacker could engineer such a situation to occur  they might be able to make loops or other arbitrary chains of linear pagetables  as described in XSA-240. A malicious or buggy PV guest may cause the hypervisor to crash  resulting in Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be excluded. All versions of Xen are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot leverage the vulnerability. Only systems which have enabled linear pagetables are vulnerable.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 AMD HVM guest OS users to cause a denial of service or possibly gain privileges by triggering data-structure access during pagetable-height updates. When running on AMD systems with an IOMMU  Xen attempted to dynamically adapt the number of levels of pagetables (the pagetable height) in the IOMMU according to the guest s address space size. The code to select and update the height had several bugs. Notably  the update was done without taking a lock which is necessary for safe operation. A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to access data structures while they are being modified  causing Xen to crash. Privilege escalation is thought to be very difficult but cannot be ruled out. Additionally  there is a potential memory leak of 4kb per guest boot  under memory pressure. Only Xen on AMD CPUs is vulnerable. Xen running on Intel CPUs is not vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable. Only systems where guests are given direct access to physical devices are vulnerable. Systems which do not use PCI pass-through are not vulnerable. Only HVM guests can exploit the vulnerability. PV and PVH guests cannot. All versions of Xen with IOMMU support are vulnerable.,Guest OS
A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings Mobile (iOS) could allow an unauthenticated  remote attacker to gain unauthorized read access to sensitive data by using an invalid Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate. The vulnerability is due to insufficient SSL certificate validation by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted SSL certificate to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to decrypt confidential information on user connections to the affected software.,Channel

It was found that the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 kpatch update did not include the complete fix for CVE-2018-12207. A flaw was found in the way Intel CPUs handle inconsistency between  virtual to physical memory address translations in CPU s local cache and system software s Paging structure entries. A privileged guest user may use this flaw to induce a hardware Machine Check Error on the host processor  resulting in a severe DoS scenario by halting the processor. System software like OS OR Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) use virtual memory system for storing program instructions and data in memory. Virtual Memory system uses Paging structures like Page Tables and Page Directories to manage system memory. The processor s Memory Management Unit (MMU) uses Paging structure entries to translate program s virtual memory addresses to physical memory addresses. The processor stores these address translations into its local cache buffer called - Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB). TLB has two parts  one for instructions and other for data addresses. System software can modify its Paging structure entries to change address mappings OR certain attributes like page size etc. Upon such Paging structure alterations in memory  system software must invalidate the corresponding address translations in the processor s TLB cache. But before this TLB invalidation takes place  a privileged guest user may trigger an instruction fetch operation  which could use an already cached  but now invalid  virtual to physical address translation from Instruction TLB (ITLB). Thus accessing an invalid physical memory address and resulting in halting the processor due to the Machine Check Error (MCE) on Page Size Change.,Host OS
A flaw was found in the fix for CVE-2019-11135  in the Linux upstream kernel versions before 5.5 where  the way Intel CPUs handle speculative execution of instructions when a TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA) error occurs. When a guest is running on a host CPU affected by the TAA flaw (TAA_NO=0)  but is not affected by the MDS issue (MDS_NO=1)  the guest was to clear the affected buffers by using a VERW instruction mechanism. But when the MDS_NO=1 bit was exported to the guests  the guests did not use the VERW mechanism to clear the affected buffers. This issue affects guests running on Cascade Lake CPUs and requires that host has  TSX  enabled. Confidentiality of data is the highest threat associated with this vulnerability.,Host OS

On SHIFT BitBox02 devices  a side channel for the row-based OLED display was found. The power consumption of each row-based display cycle depends on the number of illuminated pixels  allowing a partial recovery of display contents. For example  a hardware implant in the USB cable might be able to leverage this behavior to recover confidential secrets such as the PIN and BIP39 mnemonic. Note: BIP39 secrets are not displayed by default on this device. The side channel is relevant only if the attacker has enough control over the device s USB connection to make power-consumption measurements at a time when secret data is displayed. The side channel is not relevant in other circumstances  such as a stolen device that is not currently displaying secret data.,Channel

Client-side certificate authentication is disabled by default.,Channel
An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing 32-bit PV guest OS users to gain guest OS privileges by installing and using descriptors. There is missing descriptor table limit checking in x86 PV emulation. When emulating certain PV guest operations  descriptor table accesses are performed by the emulating code. Such accesses should respect the guest specified limits  unless otherwise guaranteed to fail in such a case. Without this  emulation of 32-bit guest user mode calls through call gates would allow guest user mode to install and then use descriptors of their choice  as long as the guest kernel did not itself install an LDT. (Most OSes don t install any LDT by default). 32-bit PV guest user mode can elevate its privileges to that of the guest kernel. Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are affected. Only 32-bit PV guest user mode can leverage this vulnerability. HVM  PVH  as well as 64-bit PV guests cannot leverage this vulnerability. Arm systems are unaffected.,Guest OS
An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing ARM guest OS users to cause a denial of service via a XENMEM_add_to_physmap hypercall. p2m->max_mapped_gfn is used by the functions p2m_resolve_translation_fault() and p2m_get_entry() to sanity check guest physical frame. The rest of the code in the two functions will assume that there is a valid root table and check that with BUG_ON(). The function p2m_get_root_pointer() will ignore the unused top bits of a guest physical frame. This means that the function p2m_set_entry() will alias the frame. However  p2m->max_mapped_gfn will be updated using the original frame. It would be possible to set p2m->max_mapped_gfn high enough to cover a frame that would lead p2m_get_root_pointer() to return NULL in p2m_get_entry() and p2m_resolve_translation_fault(). Additionally  the sanity check on p2m->max_mapped_gfn is off-by-one allowing  highest mapped + 1  to be considered valid. However  p2m_get_root_pointer() will return NULL. The problem could be triggered with a specially crafted hypercall XENMEM_add_to_physmap{  _batch} followed by an access to an address (via hypercall or direct access) that passes the sanity check but cause p2m_get_root_pointer() to return NULL. A malicious guest administrator may cause a hypervisor crash  resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Xen version 4.8 and newer are vulnerable. Only Arm systems are vulnerable. x86 systems are not affected.,Hypervisor
An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing ARM guest OS users to cause a denial of service or gain privileges by leveraging the erroneous enabling of interrupts. Interrupts are unconditionally unmasked in exception handlers. When an exception occurs on an ARM system which is handled without changing processor level  some interrupts are unconditionally enabled during exception entry. So exceptions which occur when interrupts are masked will effectively unmask the interrupts. A malicious guest might contrive to arrange for critical Xen code to run with interrupts erroneously enabled. This could lead to data corruption  denial of service  or possibly even privilege escalation. However a precise attack technique has not been identified.,Guest OS
An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users to gain host OS privileges by leveraging race conditions in pagetable promotion and demotion operations. There are issues with restartable PV type change operations. To avoid using shadow pagetables for PV guests  Xen exposes the actual hardware pagetables to the guest. In order to prevent the guest from modifying these page tables directly  Xen keeps track of how pages are used using a type system; pages must be  promoted  before being used as a pagetable  and  demoted  before being used for any other type. Xen also allows for  recursive  promotions: i.e.  an operating system promoting a page to an L4 pagetable may end up causing pages to be promoted to L3s  which may in turn cause pages to be promoted to L2s  and so on. These operations may take an arbitrarily large amount of time  and so must be re-startable. Unfortunately  making recursive pagetable promotion and demotion operations restartable is incredibly complicated  and the code contains several races which  if triggered  can cause Xen to drop or retain extra type counts  potentially allowing guests to get write access to in-use pagetables. A malicious PV guest administrator may be able to escalate their privilege to that of the host. All x86 systems with untrusted PV guests are vulnerable. HVM and PVH guests cannot exercise this vulnerability.,Guest OS
An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users to cause a denial of service via a VCPUOP_initialise hypercall. hypercall_create_continuation() is a variadic function which uses a printf-like format string to interpret its parameters. Error handling for a bad format character was done using BUG()  which crashes Xen. One path  via the VCPUOP_initialise hypercall  has a bad format character. The BUG() can be hit if VCPUOP_initialise executes for a sufficiently long period of time for a continuation to be created. Malicious guests may cause a hypervisor crash  resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Xen versions 4.6 and newer are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.5 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. HVM and PVH guests  and guests on ARM systems  cannot exploit the vulnerability.,Hypervisor

OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL_init_crypto() explicitly using OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORK then this problem does not occur at all. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c).,Channel
Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However  in some cases  it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k).

The ARM-based hardware debugging feature on Raspberry Pi 3 module B+ and possibly other devices allows non-secure EL1 code to read/write any EL3 (the highest privilege level in ARMv8) memory/register via inter-processor debugging. With a debug host processor A running in non-secure EL1 and a debug target processor B running in any privilege level  the debugging feature allows A to halt B and promote B to any privilege level. As a debug host  A has full control of B even if B owns a higher privilege level than A. Accordingly  A can read/write any EL3 memory/register via B. Also  with this memory access  A can execute arbitrary code in EL3.,Physical Hardware
