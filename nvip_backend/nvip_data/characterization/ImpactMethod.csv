When configured to enable default typing  Jackson contained a deserialization vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary code execution. Jackson fixed this vulnerability by blacklisting known deserialization gadgets. Spring Batch configures Jackson with global default typing enabled which means that through the previous exploit  arbitrary code could be executed if all of the following is true: * Spring Batchs Jackson support is being leveraged to serialize a jobs ExecutionContext. * A malicious user gains write access to the data store used by the JobRepository (where the data to be deserialized is stored). In order to protect against this type of attack  Jackson prevents a set of untrusted gadget classes from being deserialized. Spring Batch should be proactive against blocking unknown deserialization gadgets when enabling default typing.,Code Execution

A vulnerability was found in keycloak before 6.0.2. The X.509 authenticator supports the verification of client certificates through the CRL  where the CRL list can be obtained from the URL provided in the certificate itself (CDP) or through the separately configured path.

An exploitable information leak vulnerability exists in the ustream-ssl library of OpenWrt  versions 18.06.4 and 15.05.1. When connecting to a remote server  the servers SSL certificate is checked but no action is taken when the certificate is invalid. An attacker could exploit this behavior by performing a man-in-the-middle attack  providing any certificate  leading to the theft of all the data sent by the client during the first request. After an SSL connection is initialized via _ustream_ssl_init  and after any data (e.g. the clients HTTP request) is written to the stream using ustream_printf  the code eventually enters the function __ustream_ssl_poll  which is used to dispatch the read/write events,Man-in-the-Middle

A vulnerability in the Kerberos authentication feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated  remote attacker to impersonate the Kerberos key distribution center (KDC) and bypass authentication on an affected device that is configured to perform Kerberos authentication for VPN or local device access. The vulnerability is due to insufficient identity verification of the KDC when a successful authentication response is received. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by spoofing the KDC server response to the ASA device. This malicious response would not have been authenticated by the KDC. A successful attack could allow an attacker to bypass Kerberos authentication.,Authentication Bypass

A vulnerability in the implementation of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Message Digest 5 (MD5) authentication in Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated  remote attacker to bypass MD5 authentication and establish a BGP connection with the device. The vulnerability occurs because the BGP MD5 authentication is bypassed if the peer does not have MD5 authentication configured  the NX-OS device does have BGP MD5 authentication configured  and the NX-OS BGP virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) name is configured to be greater than 19 characters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to establish a BGP session with the NX-OS peer. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to establish a BGP session with the NX-OS device without MD5 authentication. The Cisco implementation of the BGP protocol accepts incoming BGP traffic only from explicitly configured peers. To exploit this vulnerability  an attacker must send the malicious packets over a TCP connection that appears to come from a trusted BGP peer. To do so  the attacker must obtain information about the BGP peers in the affected system&rsquo;s trusted network.,Authentication Bypass

An issue was discovered on Mitsubishi Electric ME-RTU devices through 2.02 and INEA ME-RTU devices through 3.0. Hard-coded SSH keys allow an attacker to gain unauthorised access or disclose encrypted data on the RTU due to the keys not being regenerated on initial installation or with firmware updates. In other words  these devices use private-key values in /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key  /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key  and /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key files that are publicly available from the vendor web sites.,Trust Failure

In Cloudera Navigator Key Trustee KMS 5.12 and 5.13  incorrect default ACL values allow remote access to purge and undelete API calls on encryption zone keys. The Navigator Key Trustee KMS includes 2 API calls in addition to those in Apache Hadoop KMS: purge and undelete. The KMS ACL values for these commands are keytrustee.kms.acl.PURGE and keytrustee.kms.acl.UNDELETE respectively. The default value for the ACLs in Key Trustee KMS 5.12.0 and 5.13.0 is * which allows anyone with knowledge of the name of an encryption zone key and network access to the Key Trustee KMS to make those calls against known encryption zone keys. This can result in the recovery of a previously deleted  but not purged  key (undelete) or the deletion of a key in active use (purge) resulting in loss of access to encrypted HDFS data.,Trust Failure

An issue was discovered in supplementary Go cryptography libraries  aka golang-googlecode-go-crypto  before 2019-03-20. A flaw was found in the amd64 implementation of golang.org/x/crypto/salsa20 and golang.org/x/crypto/salsa20/salsa. If more than 256 GiB of keystream is generated  or if the counter otherwise grows greater than 32 bits  the amd64 implementation will first generate incorrect output  and then cycle back to previously generated keystream. Repeated keystream bytes can lead to loss of confidentiality in encryption applications  or to predictability in CSPRNG applications.,Trust Failure

A vulnerability in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) functionality of software for Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode could allow an unauthenticated  local attacker with physical access to view sensitive information on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper data-protection mechanisms for disk encryption keys that are used within the partitions on an affected device hard drive. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by obtaining physical access to the affected device to view certain cleartext keys. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute a custom boot process or conduct further attacks on an affected device.,Trust Failure
A vulnerability in Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) Software could allow an unauthenticated  local attacker with physical access to obtain sensitive information from an affected device.

Incorrect Access Controls of Security Officer (SO) in PKCS11 R2 provider that ships with the Utimaco CryptoServer HSM product package allows an SO authenticated to a slot to retrieve attributes of keys marked as private keys in external key storage  and also delete keys marked as private keys in external key storage. This compromises the availability of all keys configured with external key storage and may result in an economic attack in which the attacker denies legitimate users access to keys while maintaining possession of an encrypted copy (blob) of the external key store for ransom. This attack has been dubbed reverse ransomware attack and may be executed via a physical connection to the CryptoServer or remote connection if SSH or remote access to LAN CryptoServer has been compromised. The Confidentiality and Integrity of the affected keys  however  remain untarnished.,Trust Failure
