# NVIP Data Repository

This repo contains the data/resources needed to run the NVIP project.

### Quick info about each REQUIRED sub-directory 
* ./mysql-database: The dump of the MySQL database. 
> You need to install MySQL and create the nvip database before running the nvip system. After you install MySQL you should tune the parameters (i.e. user and password) in the db-mysql.properties file! 
* ./characterization: Training data (CSV files) for AI/ML-based CVE characterization.
* ./productnameextraction: Training data and resources used to extract product names from CVE descriptions via LSTM.
* ./cvss: Data/script used for CVSS scoring. 

### How to Use
You should clone this directory (nvip_data) and add its path as NVIP data path in the 'nvip.properties' file of the nvip_backend project.
> Ex: dataDir = ../nvip_data
