# National Vulnerability Intelligence Platform (NVIP) - Data Repository

This repo contains the data/resources needed to run the NVIP project.

### Quick info about each REQUIRED sub-directory 
* ./mysql-database: The dump of the MySQL database. 
You need to import this database before running nvip. After you install MySQL you should tune the parameters in the db-mysql.properties file! 
* ./characterization: Training data (CSV files) for AI/ML-based CVE characterization.
* ./productnameextraction: Training data and resources used to extract product names from CVE descriptions via LSTM.
* ./cvss: Data/script used for CVSS scoring. 


### OPTIONAL sub directories/files
Please note that the directories/files listed here are NOT required. They might be created when the nvip system is run.
* ./mitre-cve: The clone of the MITRE CVEs at https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist.git
* .mitre-cve.csv: CVE data pulled from MITRE
* .nvd-cve.csv: CVE data pulled from US National Vulnerability Database.
* ./url-sources: The list of CVE source URLs in NVD.
* ./exploit-repo: The clone of the exploit repo at https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb
* .cnnvd-cve.csv: CVE data pulled from Chinese National Vulnerability Database
* ./cnnvd-cve: Created to store CVEs scraped from http://cnnvd.org.cn/

### How to Use
You should clone this directory (nvip_data) and add its path as NVIP data path in the 'nvip.properties' file of the nvip_backend project.
Ex: dataDir = ../nvip_data
