# NVIP Data Repository

This repo contains the data/resources needed to run the NVIP project.

### Quick info about each REQUIRED sub-directory 
* ./mysql-database: The dump of the MySQL database. 
> You need to import this database before running nvip. After you install MySQL you should tune the parameters in the db-mysql.properties file! 
* ./characterization: Training data (CSV files) for AI/ML-based CVE characterization.
* ./productnameextraction: Training data and resources used to extract product names from CVE descriptions via LSTM.
* ./cvss: Data/script used for CVSS scoring. 

### How to Use
You should clone this directory (nvip_data) and add its path as NVIP data path in the 'nvip.properties' file of the nvip_backend project.
> Ex: dataDir = ../nvip_data
