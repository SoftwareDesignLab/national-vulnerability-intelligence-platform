NVIP automates the collection of\n      CVEs, providing near real-time publishing of vulnerabilities, as well as\n      intelligent analysis and categorization of these vulnerabilities. This\n      page provides a summary of the most recent vulnerabilities found by NVIP.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      Loading daily vulnerability data...\n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          {{ vulnMap.date }}\n        \n        \n          {{ vulnMap.cve_list.length }} CVEs identified\n        \n        \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          No CVEs identified\n        \n        \n          \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Show More\n          \n          \n            Show Less\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n    \n\n    \n                \n                    ./recent.component.css\n                \n                /** Daily CVE Page Styles **/\n:root {\n  --font-size: 1em;\n  --font-size-lg: 1.2em;\n  --filter-container-width: 32em;\n}\n\n.daily-cve-container {\n  background-color: #b8c6db;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n}\n\n/** Daily Vulnerability Filter Panel **/\n\n.daily-cve-filter-container {\n  background-color: #ffffff;\n  border-radius: 0px 25px 25px 0px;\n  height: calc(30em -
