## Main Feaures
* NVIP crawls a given list of vulnerability sources and creates a dynamic database of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). 
* Provides near real time detection of disclosed vulnerabilities by checking CVE Numbering Authorities web sites.
* Provides AI/ML-based CVE Characterization via NIST's Vulnerability Description Ontology (VDO) framework.
* Automated CVSS scoring based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 3.1 specification.
* Automated CVE Reconciling using Apache Open NLP.
* Uses LSTM/Word2Vec to extract affected Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) product names from free-form CVE descriptions.
* Includes utilities to pull CVEs from the US National Vulnerability Database [(NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/), [MITRE CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/) and Chinese National Vulnerability Database [(CNNVD)](http://www.cnnvd.org.cn/).

## Main Components
For more details about each component please refer to the Readme files under each directory.

### nvip_backend
The back end platform that does all CVE crawling, characterization, product name extraction, and CVSS scoring etc.

### nvip_ui
The proof-of-concept user interface that lists crawled/characterized CVEs.

### nvip_data
The repository that includes the training data sets and required resources for CVE characterization, product name extraction and CVSS scoring.

### nvip_lib
External jar files (libraries) that might be needed while running the nvip backend system.

## Quick Start Steps
To start using nvip:
* Install MySQL (version 8) and create the nvip database by executing the SQL script provided at "nvip_data/mysql-database".
This can be done using "Server/Data Import" menu in the MySQL Workbench (version 8).

* Once the database is created, run the jar file named "nvip-1.0.jar", by opening the command prompt and executing the command "java -Xms8G -Xmx16G -jar nvip-1.0.jar".
The system will scrape CVE sources (URLs) included in the 'nvipsourceurl' table and update CVEs in the mysql database. By default the system is pulling most recent CVEs 
from Packet Storm, Tenable, Mitre Git repo etc., therefore after the run, around 200K CVEs will be recorded in the MySQL database.
** Note: To have the most up-to-date URLS in the nvipsourceurl table run "java -Xms1G -Xmx4G -cp "nvip-1.0.jar;nvip_lib/*" edu.rit.se.nvip.cvesource.UpdateNvipSourceUrlList"

* To start viewing scraped CVEs, install the nvip_ui project. 
For details about how to setup the nvip_ui project, please check the instructions in "nvip_ui/Readme.md".
