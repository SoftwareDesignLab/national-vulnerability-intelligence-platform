# The National Vulnerability Intelligence Platform (NVIP) Project
NVIP is an open source Java platform that provides an efficient management of the software vulnerability data.

## Features
- NVIP crawls a given list of vulnerability sources (links) and creates a dynamic database of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). 
- Provides near real time detection of disclosed vulnerabilities using automated mining techniques to check CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) web sites.
- Provides AI/ML-based CVE Characterization via NIST's Vulnerability Description Ontology (VDO) framework.
- Automated CVSS scoring based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 3.1 specification.
- Automatically reconciles CVEs using Apache Open NLP.
- Uses LSTM/Word2Vec to extract affected Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) product names from free-form CVE descriptions.
- Includes utilities to pull CVEs from the US National Vulnerability Database [(NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/), [MITRE CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/) and Chinese National Vulnerability Database [(CNNVD)](http://www.cnnvd.org.cn/).

## Components
For more details about each component please refer to the Readme files under each directory.

### nvip_backend
The back end platform that does all CVE mining, characterization, product name extraction, and CVSS scoring etc.

### nvip_ui
The proof-of-concept user interface that lists crawled and characterized CVEs.

### nvip_data
The repository that includes the training data sets and required resources for CVE characterization, product name extraction and CVSS scoring.

### nvip_lib
jar files (libraries) that are needed to run the nvip backend system.

## Quick Start Steps
To start using nvip:
- Install MySQL (version 8) as well as MYSQL workbench and Command Line Client 

- Create the nvip database by executing the SQL script provided at "nvip_data/mysql-database" (Most Previous version is NVIPDBInit.sql as of 08/20/21). 
This can be done using "Server/Data Import" menu in the MySQL Workbench, or via the MySQL command line using the 'source' command.

- Once the database is created, run the jar file named "nvip-1.0.jar", by opening the command prompt and executing the command "java -Xms8G -Xmx16G -jar nvip-1.0.jar".
The system will scrape CVE sources (URLs) included in the 'nvipsourceurl' table and update CVEs in the mysql database. 

- To start viewing scraped CVEs, install the nvip\_ui project. For details about how to setup the nvip\_ui project, please check the instructions in "nvip_ui/Readme.md".

> Note: To have the most up-to-date CVE sources in the nvipsourceurl table in mysql, you need to run the CVE source update tool by:
>"java -Xms1G -Xmx4G -cp "nvip-1.0.jar;nvip_lib/*" edu.rit.se.nvip.cvesource.UpdateNvipSourceUrlList"

> If there's any issues with installing the database, try adjusting the NVIPMain.java run configurations then running as a Java application (located in nvip_backend).
> In the program arguments, insert the file path of the .txt file containing your CVE sources and run
> (We'd recommend testing with cve-source-2URLs.txt, which is located in nvip_backend/src/test/resources)
> Once it's finished, be check via MySQL that the data was imported by querying to the vulnerability table
> If the data exists, then you should be able to view the CVE's when running the UI
