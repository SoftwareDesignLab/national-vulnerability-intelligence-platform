# The National Vulnerability Intelligence Platform (NVIP) Project
NVIP is an open source Java platform that provides an efficient management of the software vulnerability data.

## Features
- NVIP is a publicly available resource providing rich, near real-time CVE intelligence.
- Provides near real time detection of disclosed vulnerabilities using automated mining techniques to check CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) web sites and many other online sources.
- It crawls a given list of vulnerability sources (links) and creates a dynamic database of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE).
- Provides AI/ML-based CVE Characterization via NISTâ€™s Vulnerability Description Ontology (VDO) framework.
- Automated CVSS scoring based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 3.1 specification.
- Automatically reconciles CVEs description using Apache Open NLP to find the best description.
- Uses LSTM/Word2Vec to extract affected Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) product names from free-form CVE descriptions.

## Components
For more details about each component please refer to the Readme files under each directory.

### nvip_backend
The back end platform that does all CVE mining, characterization, product name extraction, and CVSS scoring etc.

### nvip_ui
The proof-of-concept user interface that lists crawled and characterized CVEs.

### nvip_data
The repository that includes the training data sets and required resources for CVE characterization, product name extraction and CVSS scoring.

### nvip_lib
jar files (libraries) that are needed to run the nvip backend system.

## Quick Start Steps
To start using nvip:
- Install MySQL (version 8) as well as MYSQL workbench and Command Line Client. 

- Create the nvip database by executing the SQL script provided at "nvip_data/mysql-database" in the MySQL Workbench. 
The script can be executed in a query editor in the MySQL Workbench (File/New Query Tab).

- Once the database is created, run the jar file named "nvip-1.0.jar", by opening the command prompt and executing the command "java -Xms8G -Xmx16G -jar nvip-1.0.jar".
The system will scrape CVE sources (URLs) included in the 'nvipsourceurl' table and update CVEs in the MySQL database. 

- To start viewing scraped CVEs, install the nvip\_ui project. For details about how to setup the nvip\_ui project, please follow the instructions in "nvip_ui/Readme.md".

> Note: To have the most up-to-date CVE sources in the nvipsourceurl table in mysql, you may want to run the CVE source update tool by:
>"java -Xms1G -Xmx4G -cp "nvip-1.0.jar;nvip_lib/*" edu.rit.se.nvip.cvesource.UpdateNvipSourceUrlList"
